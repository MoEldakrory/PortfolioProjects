Project Overview
Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze car sales data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The dataset, named Car_Prices,
includes various attributes related to car sales such as make, model, state, selling price, and sale date. The project involved data cleaning, manipulation,
and executing various SQL queries to generate reports and insights.

Dataset
The dataset Car_Prices was created and populated with a CSV file. The table structure includes columns such as year, make, model, trim, body,
tranmission, vin, state, condition, odometer, color,interior, seller, mmr, sellingprice, and saledate.
